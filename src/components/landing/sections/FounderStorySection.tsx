          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4 italic">"I started onetradejournal because I was frustrated with the expensive and complicated journaling tools on the market."</p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            As an options trader for over 5 years, I struggled to find a journaling tool that was both powerful and easy to use. Most platforms were either too complex or didn't provide the insights I needed to grow as a trader.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            I built onetradejournal to solve my own problems first - tracking my trades, understanding my patterns, and most importantly, building consistency through daily habits. What started as a personal project has grown into a platform that helps traders of all levels improve their performance.

            Our mission is simple: help traders build better habits through thoughtful journaling and powerful analytics at an affordable price.
