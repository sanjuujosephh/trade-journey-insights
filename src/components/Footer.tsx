                Investment is subject to market risks. Uncertainty is always a factor, and various risks can overlap and amplify each other, potentially leading to unforeseen impacts on the value of investments. The value of assets and any associated income may rise or fall, and there is a possibility of losing the full amount of your initial investment. Market fluctuations and related changes are just some of the factors that can influence these variations. Historical performance does not guarantee or predict future results.
